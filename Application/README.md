The alarms we set or the reminders we save are to do some important thing at a particular time however most of the things can be done only at a particular place. 
The main idea of this project is to create a list of task which the user needs to be reminded about. He selects the location and sets the time duration for the reminder.  If in this duration the user comes in vicinity of that location an alarm goes on the phone of the user and he is reminded.
